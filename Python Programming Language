How did Python dominate scientific computing?

Because it is a more general language than any other in the scientific world. Also, it is free software.

For example, you can easily apply Python for your scientific computations, as well as for a GUI application, or a network client. Scientists are not like programmers and they generally prefer to learn the fewest programming languages and tools as possible. It is a matter of convenience, they can learn Python and use it everywhere.

Also, it is free software. MATLAB, for example, is not free, and its free implementation, GNU Octave, doesn't have a very big community at the moment.

About performance, they are about the same. Some studies say that Numpy and MATLAB perform similarly, with Python code optimizations doing better than MATLAB. Also, Python code is easily parallelizable using MPI [1], and this is important for scientific computations. [2]
